# Computer Vision Presentation for Self Driving Cars given at upcode academy

This is the presentation of the first course in computer vision for self driving cars by upcode academy.

## To open the presentation please go to:

### Option 1: execute remotely (easier option)

[lanesdetection.marcogg.com](http://lanesdetection.marcogg.com)

### Option 2: execte locally (for the more experience ones)

1. Install conda, see its [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. Clone this repo using git
3. Create a new conda environment  

```
$ conda env create -n lanedetection -f binder/environment.yml
```

4. Execute the jupyter notebook

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the url shown in the console with your favourite browser

### Option 3: checkout the notebook (with no option to execute the code)

[Online notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marcoag/lanes_detection/blob/master/Computer%20Vision%20%28Python%29.ipynb)

Once opened you can see it in presentation mode (by clicking on the icon on the top right corner that looks like a present). 
Although no style file will be loaded and your presentation background will be plain white.

All the code can be found at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcoag/lanes_detection).
